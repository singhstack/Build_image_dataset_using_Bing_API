# Build_image_dataset_using_Bing_API
Getting relevant datasets can be tedious and time consuming... especially when you know the images you want and by the time you'll manually save the appropriate amount (thousands) to train your deep neural network... you might just rage quit.

So here's a programt that allows you to choose a label, download relevant images and create a database for your machine learning application.

What do you need for this?

A BING API Key- which you don't even need to pay for (unless ofcourse you're using one).

By creating an account with Microsoft Cognitive Services and taking a 7 day trial, you get 2 keys- which should be enough for this program.

So dive in to the code and get started!
